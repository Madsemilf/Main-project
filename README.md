# Main-project-slideshow-quiz-todo

This is my final exam project in FFU1100-1 22H. 
The project reflects what we have learned through our first semester of front end development in HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania.

Project includes a slideshow, a quiz and a to-do list, and is implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Figma prototype is also included.

Here is a link to the project repository: https://github.com/Madsemilf/Main-project.git

Quiz needs some patching..
